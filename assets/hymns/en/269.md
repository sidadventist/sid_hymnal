## A Wonderful Savior

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
a wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
where rivers of pleasure I see.

Chorus
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
that shadows a dry thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love
and covers me there with His hand,
and covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved;
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
and filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
for such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
to meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I'll shout with the millions on high

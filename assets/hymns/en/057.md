## Whosover Heareth

"Whosoever heareth!" shout, shout the sound!
Send the blessed tidings all the world around;
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found:

Chorus
"Whosoever will may come!"
"Whosoever will! whosoever will!"
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
"Whosoever will may come!"

"Whosoever cometh" need not delay,
Now the door is open, enter while you may;
Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
"Whosoever will may come!"

"Whosoever will!" the promise is secure;
"Whosoever will," forever must endure;
"Whosoever will!" 'tis life forevermore;
"Whosoever will may come."

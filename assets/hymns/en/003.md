## Face To Face

Face to face with Christ my Saviour,
Face to face what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me. 

refrain
Face to face shall I behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory.
I shall see Him by and by! 

Only faintly now, I see Him,
With the dark'ning veil between,
But the blessed day is coming; 
When His glory shall be seen. 

What rejoicing in His in His presence, 
When Are banished grief and pain,
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain. 

Face to face! O! blissful moment!
Face to face to see and know;
Face to face with my redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves so.
